## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello and thanks for stopping by! This repository showcases my ongoing work and experiments as a cloud developer specializing in Google Cloud Platform (GCP). My primary focus is building serverless applications, designing event-driven architectures, and automating scalable, resilient infrastructure using GCP-native tools.

Here, youâ€™ll find projects and utilities centered around Cloud Functions, Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), and BigQueryâ€”three of the most powerful components of the GCP ecosystem. Whether it's writing lightweight Cloud Functions to respond to Pub/Sub events or automating CI/CD pipelines to deploy containerized apps on GKE, each project reflects real-world use cases aimed at modernizing cloud-native workflows.

Cloud Functions: Explore examples of asynchronous data processing, webhook integration, and microservices architecture without managing servers.

GKE: Dive into scalable Kubernetes deployments, Helm charts, and infrastructure-as-code configurations using tools like Terraform and Config Connector.

BigQuery: Analyze large datasets with ease, automate scheduled queries, and integrate data pipelines for real-time insights.

This repository is a mix of production-ready components, quick-start templates, and proof-of-concept experiments. It's built for cloud engineers, DevOps professionals, and developers looking to expand their understanding of serverless systems and GCP infrastructure.

Feel free to fork, contribute, or ask questionsâ€”collaboration is always welcome. Each folder includes README files with context and deployment instructions to get you up and running quickly.
